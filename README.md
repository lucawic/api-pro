# Collaborative Front-End Development


## Description 

Collaborative Front-End Development: Camping Buddy
An app to serve as a planning tool for a camping trip. Using the National Park Service in
combination with Open Weather and Open Layer to provide useful information for your trip.


Challenge Elements

integrating data received from multiple server-side API requests to create an interactive 
front-end project . Because you will be working collaboratively, you will learn agile 
development methodologies and implement feature and bug fixes using the Git branch workflow 
and pull requests.
